My goal is to try my hand at programming. The more I study front-end development, the more I realize that it is an interesting and endless job.
I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, nodejs.
My experience is 3 months on frontend developer courses.
I graduated from University named after Francisk Skorina, the faculty of Economics, Finance and credit.
I'm studying courses called "TeachMeSkills" and started studying the EPAM training.
I'm trying to improve my English.
